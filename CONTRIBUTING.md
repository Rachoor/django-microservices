* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
    * Describe the scenario when you found the bug
    * Describe the problem
* Write unit tests for your fix if applicable

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**
